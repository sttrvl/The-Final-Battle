// death and sick characters should be removed if death, since the message sometimes displays after death done, fixed
// still ongoing for plague sickness            seems to be fixed

// when a dagger gets added, the dagger attack displays first when it should be last
// cursor goes down, we could force it to stay in place
// some characters still survive after 0 health 

// I need to add like something to put automatically spaces in display maybe


// if 0 souls do not display the gauge fill

// re order events
// add methods to modify the structs instead of doing it directly

// turnmanager          done
// game                 done
